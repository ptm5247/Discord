This branch is most of the way through a large refactoring with the following purposes:
1. flat, not nested
2. code reusability
3. organization of classes as well as functionality

The following still need to be done for the originally planned portion of the refactoring to be considered complete:
1. implement signal splitting logic found in DiscordAPI.py to various listeners of dsignals
2. increase the scope of DiscordUI.py to contain all major ui elements instead of just top level containers
3. write single handlers for qsignals handlers like guild_selected and channel_selected and place them in DiscordUI.py
4. get rid of _utils.py lol (optional)
5. remove type checking imports from discord_app.Registrar
6. make sure it actually works

The zip file pre-refactoring contains a copy of the branch made towards the beginning of the refactoring in case this is resurrected and needs to be rolled back (good luck)
